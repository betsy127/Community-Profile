**Why this is important now:**
From the silent generation to millennials, same-sex marriage is increasingly becoming more accepted. According to a Pew Research poll conducted in early 2014, in the silent generation there has been an 80% increase in acceptance while millennials have increased by 33% from 2001 to 2014. Lesbians and bisexual women are no longer hiding as with acceptance comes a higher level of comfort. 
While the presence of lesbian and bisexual women has become increasingly popular there should, in turn, be less and less abnormality around the subject. A change in how lesbians and bisexual women are referred to is significant in order to become inclusive of everyday norms. 


**Who might care about this:**
Lesbians and bi-sexual women who feel outcasted by society. Americans may not realize the discrimination towards this group of people by solely basing the women on whom they have sex with and not understanding the “love is love” concept.

Millennials acceptance increased from 51% to 68%, and baby boomers from 32% to 48%.  This demonstrates an overall acceptance of gay people being equal to heterosexuals, and can facilitate an inclusion of lesbians as a norm instead of as the variable.
