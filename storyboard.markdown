**Overview**

The LGBT community is becoming more prevalent with each passing year. Only 13 states are currently withholding the rights for same-sex couples to get married. According to the data,   the LGBT community is growing, however it's possible that citizens are just becoming more comfortable and confident in publicly stating their sexuality Therefore, more data is finally being published on this demographic.

  The data on lesbian salaries/income/how much time they spend consuming media would be an incentive for their inclusion on more mainstream platforms, and not just on lesbian outlets. The point of our research is to go beyond just same sex marriage/LGBT rights, and to create a reason for the media to see how  the inclusion of the queer  community and not only "separate but equal platforms, in mainstream culture will have great economic advantages for these companies.

In the media, gay men are very much more prominent than gay women, both as executives and as personalities. On television, gay men may not always be represented in the best light, however they don't go through trists of bisexuality. Often television writers have women engage in bisexual relationships, which they deem as exciting surprises for their viewers.This is often demonstrated  during the infamous "sweeps week," in which television shows go all out for the highest ratings possible  for their season finale.
